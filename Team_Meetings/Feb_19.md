### Agenda
- QIIME processing, need to select a rarefaction depth
  - Should we select 22901 (maximum balance for retaining features and samples)
  - Or should we go lower which will increase the number of samples preserved

Accurate representation of the features (species)
Each observed feature corresponds to observe bacteria → choose depth to have uniform representation of the species
Retain most number of samples (not undersample) 
Go below 22901 → see  if we can get a few samples back

Research question (more specific based on hypothesis)
- Absorption + supplementations
Do different iron absorption levels from supplements cause an overrepresentation (overgrowth) of pathogens in the gut microbiome?

- Supplementation 
Do iron supplementation cause an overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria in the gut
Does iron absorption from supplements 
Do different degrees of iron absorption from diff supplements cause an overgrowth…
Iron FeSo4 supplementation causes overrepresentation of pathogenic microbes due to reduced iron a

Discuss hypothesis
- Potential Hypothesis: FeSO4 supplementation leads to lower iron absorption in the colon, causing overrepresentation of pathogenic bacteria. 
No less double negative → less unabsorbed → MNP leads to greater absorption OR FeSO4 leads to 
reduced absorption FeSO4 in the colon correlated to overgrowth of pathogenic
“Overrepresentation” of pathogenic bacteria (increase in relative abundance) → in general pathogenic/opportunistic bacteria tend to grow faster + appear as higher relative abundance
  - This is because:
    1. Research shows that a substantial fraction of orally administered iron remains unabsorbed and reaches the colon (iron absorption is greatest in the duodenum)
    2. Differences between iron forms: Ferrous sulfate (FeSO₄) is highly soluble and releases iron rapidly, but without absorption enhancers, a large portion can remain unabsorbed in the colon. This unabsorbed iron may promote the growth of iron-dependent enteropathogens and potentially reduce protective commensals such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which generally require little iron.
    3. Advantages of MNP: Assuming the MNP contains ferrous fumarate along with vitamin C, vitamin A, zinc, and folic acid, absorption enhancers like vitamins C and A can increase iron uptake in the duodenum, reducing the fraction of iron that reaches the colon. Although ferrous fumarate is slightly less soluble than ferrous sulfate, its absorption is comparable when adjusted for elemental iron and combined with these enhancers, thereby minimizing impacts on commensal bacteria.
    - Overall: MNP supplementation may improve iron absorption in the small intestine, reducing colonic unabsorbed iron and its potential disruptive effects on the gut microbiome.

Discuss the 3 aims chosen and whether they are good to move forward with
Taxonomic profiling/diversity:
Aim 1: Determine how the microbial diversity differs after receiving MNP, FeSO4, or no supplementation in (healthy and anemic) infants. (Diversity matrix - alpha/beta) + taxa bar plot
Aim 2: core microbiome
Abundance:
Aim 3: Identify bacterial species that are differentially abundant upon iron supplementation with MNP or FeSO4 or no supplementation. (DESeq2)
Functional:
Aim 4: Functional analyses of bacteria of interest across supplementation (and anemia) status. (PiCRUSt)

Healthy vs anemic? 
the phenotype is independent of condition

Introduction
Iron supplementation for anemic people (unless anemic people absorb more iron)
Concept of supplementation and absorption
Intro → straight to microbiome and how it relates to our concepts
Assumption about MNP → important to include in intro → effect of additional components in absorption should be explained
Overall: MNP supplementation may improve iron absorption in the small intestine, reducing colonic unabsorbed iron and its potential disruptive effects on the gut microbiome.

Questions:

- How to cite UJEMI papers → look through examples from last year 
It might actually be in the UJEMi paper itself in ASM? – first page bottom right corner 
- Original paper said that samples were collected from 95 infants but the metadata has 180+ samples (we will be analyzing 187 samples) → which number should we use for the introduction/background to state how many samples are there
Authors stated x infants, but the metadata includes x infants, which will be used in our study
Would it not be both a 6 and 12 month time point? Lol true it’s like double 95 x2
- Everyone to submit the proposal or just one person? 1 person
