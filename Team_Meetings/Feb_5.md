# February 5th, 2026 Team Meeting
### Agenda
1. Discuss potential project topics:

   Typhoid Vaccine:
   - Are there any specific taxa enriched or depleted in responders vs non-responders?
   - Is gut microbiome diversity after single-dose typhoid vaccination associated with participant age?
   - Longitudinal microbiome changes across DPI (independent of responder status)?
   - Whether the dose of vaccine affects the microbiome structure of recipients independent of the antibody response category?
   - Do IgA-only and IgG-only responders have distinct microbiomes? (differences in mucosal and humoural immunity)

   Infant Feeding:
   - How does vaginal vs. C-section delivery shape infant gut microbiome diversity and community composition across [certain age]?
   - Can microbiome profiles be used to predict age?
   - Do infants with higher WLZ (weight-for-length Z score) or WAZ (weight-for-age Z score) show accelerated microbiome maturation/greater microbiome diversity? Can also look into other categories related to growth.
   - Is infant gut microbiome composition associated with appetite scores?

   Anemia during Infancy:
   - Does taking different types of iron supplementation lead to difference in gut microbiome compositions of anemic infants?

   Alcohol Consumption:
   - Are the oral microbiome community composition variations caused by alcohol consumption associated to specific alcohol-related diseases? Possibly cross reference with smoking.
     
### Meeting Minutes
Anemia during Infancy:
Does taking different types of iron supplementation lead to differences in gut microbiome compositions of anemic infants? → chosen
- Not done, good sample size
- Which iron supplements (two diff supplements vs non) → what kind and how much?
- Healthy w and w/o vs anemic w and w/o
- Diet available – breast milk, juice, solids

Project layout
12 vs 6 months (or run both parallel or keep the dataset with highest number)
Groups: 
Healthy → MNP, FeSO4, none
Anemic  → MNP, FeSO4, none

See how much humans can absorb  MNP & FeSO4 in the gut
How much iron is in each supplement (if one has higher than another then that can justify)
Justify what these groups are depending on how different they are

Run everything through new shared credentials
Preprocessing: run through QIIME pipeline 
1. Run 2 sets, 1 for anemic, 1 for healthy (identify important taxa)
2. Diversity metrics
3. Core microbiome – unique vs shared
4. Indicator taxa
5. Deseq
6. 1 functional analysis (boutique) - picrust2, predictive model of community function


### To-Do
 - Run data to process it for the proposal
 - Start early with data proposal
 - Read through the expectation for the proposal to ask Hans
 - Outline of proposal for next meeting
 - Before trimming, email Hans with read number and trim proposal
